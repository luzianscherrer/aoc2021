# Advent of Code Programming Challenge 2021

A bit late to the party but [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) seemed like a good fit to finally learn Python. After reading through a basic tutorial I was able to solve all the levels up to [23a](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23). These are all first solutions, meaning that nothing has been refined after initially solving the puzzles. Almost everything could be rewritten for readability, compactness, maintainability, obfuscation and what not. Though I don't see a point in doing so.

The hardest was by far [19a](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19) which took me several days to solve. [15b](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15) was also difficult and my solution still has a runtime of about two hours. All the others were pretty straight forward and I found that Python is a nice fit for those kinds of puzzles.

I'll try to add solutions for the remaining levels [23](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23) (this one seems to be a bit of a pain) to [25](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25) as soon as I find some spare time...
